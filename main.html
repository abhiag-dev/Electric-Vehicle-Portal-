            Electric vehicles in India
        </h2>
        <p>
            Electric vehicles are quickly catching steam in India. The rising fuel prices are also pushing a lot of
            people
            into the electric market. The development of charging infrastructure is also helping the electric space.
            Also, a
            lot of encouragement is given by the state and central government by offering subsidies for electric buyers.
        </p>

        <p>Charging infrastructure is being rapidly developed, which shows that we are moving in the right direction.
            Four-wheeler and two-wheeler markets are equally important in the country. So, for revolutionising this
            space,
            both markets need to quickly adapt to the technology of the future. Currently, the EV tech is a bit on the
            expensive side, but with quick advancement, we are going to see more affordable electric vehicles soon.</p>
        <div class="childbox">
            <p>Here are a few reasons to buy electric vehicle</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It does not pollute , since its engine does not burn fuel or generate CO2 directly. This produces a
                    very
                    positive sense of eco-awareness among the owners of these vehicles.</li>
                <li>Good acceleration . Electric motors are very powerful and dynamic and acceleration is fast and
                    constant.
                    This ease of use has a positive impact on the driver of this type of car, who sees greater
                    performance in
                    them than in his old thermal motor vehicles. </li>
                <li>Cheaper maintenance . The maintenance expense that they have had to carry out with this type of
                    vehicle is
                    practically non-existent and is limited to the annual routine inspection. The electric motor, unlike
                    the
                    thermal one, does not have cooling components that reduce the life of the motor, nor does it have
                    gears with
                    which all those parts that are difficult to fix will stop worrying us.</li>

                <li>Greater efficiency . One of the aspects that users of electric vehicles stand out most is savings,
                    since the
                    price per 1 km is around one rupee, while in the case of a fuel vehicle it would be between 6 and 8
                    rupees
                    per 100 km. You need less energy for the same effort</li>
