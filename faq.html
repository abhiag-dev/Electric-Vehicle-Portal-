            <h2>Why would one go for Electric Car?</h2>
            <p>
                Until the advantages of Electric Vehicle are more than that of conventional IC engine vehicles no one
                like
                to
                move towards them. Major vehicle manufacturers are slowly starting production of Electric Cars.
                Cleanliness, zero noise, zero tailpipe emission, less maintenance cost, less running cost etc. are
                advantages of
                Electric Cars compared to conventional vehicle.
                Since more manufacturers are coming forward with high-performance EVs it's not a bad option to go for
                Electric
                Vehicle. Future of Electric Vehicle would be promising. Selection of EVs over conventional vehicles
                depends
                on
                many other factors also.
                The initial cost of EVs is much higher. The cost would eventually get reduced since the production
                increases
                and
                technology advances.

        <div id="range">
            <h2>What is the range of an EV?</h2>
            <p>
                The range an EV has on a single charge depends on the make and model.
                Most modern EVs have a range that comfortably suits most people's daily journey. This means you can
                charge
                your
                car at home or at work without impacting your routine.
                For longer journeys it's a good idea to use rapid chargers to top up as they're the quickest way to
                charge
                your
                EV. You can often find them at motorway service car parks, petrol stations, larger shopping centres and
                supermarkets. This nicely ties in with a comfort stop on a long journey.

        <div id="lifespan">
            <h2>What's the Lifespan of an Electric Car Battery?</h2>
            <p>
                That depends on the type of battery your car uses. Lead-acid batteries, the kind that you find in
                gas-powered
                vehicles, may not last a full year. Other types of batteries -- like lithium-iron-phosphate batteries --
                can
                last up to 10 years or longer.

        <div id="recharge">
            <h2>How do we recharge an EV?</h2>
            <p>
                There will be always one common questions about electric cars related to charging! An Electric Vehicle
                moves
                using the energy stored in the battery. As fuel refill in a conventional vehicle, the battery has to be
                recharged in an electric vehicle.
                Different kinds of charging facilities are available for an EV.
            <ul>
                <li>Home charging</li>
                <li>Fast charging</li>
                <li>Charging station</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="dependable">
            <h2>Are Electric Cars Dependable?</h2>
            <p>
                Assuming they're made properly, they're just as dependable as gas-powered vehicles. In fact, electric
                motors
                have fewer moving parts and therefore, fewer points of failure than gas-powered engines.

        </div>

        <div id="incentives">
            <h2>How do government incentives work for EV's</h2>
            <p>
                Indian government offers financial incentives for anyone who wants to buy a battery powered
                automobile.When
                paying off an EV loan, a total tax exemption of up to Rs 1,50,000 is available under section 80EEB. This
                tax
                break is applicable for both four-wheeler and two-wheeler electric vehicle purchases.

        <div id="ready">
            <h2>Is India ready for Electric Vehicles?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, India is ready:<br>
                • India has been manufacturing indigenously and successfully using Electric Locomotives that pull train
                coaches
                with thousands of tons of load. This has not only saved conventional fuel like coal, diesel but has also
                saved
                the environment from getting polluted further. Accordingly, manufacturing and using the electric cars is
                not a
                big hurdle.<br>
                • While prominent manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki India, Hero Electric Vehicles, Mahindra and
                Mahindra are
                already registered electric manufacturers in India, latest collaborations such as Suzuki and Toyota, are
                planning to launch electric vehicles in India.
